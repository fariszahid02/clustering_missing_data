# Visual Analysis of Missing Patterns Using Clustering and Correlation

Missing values in datasets are often neglected but analyzing them can provide valuable insights that go 
beyond conventional methods like imputation or elimination. This dissertation investigates how 
clustering and correlation analysis can uncover underlying structures within missing data, offering a 
deeper understanding of how missingness is interpreted and addressed during data preprocessing. A 
series of clustering algorithms are explored and compared, including Hierarchical Clustering, 
DBSCAN, K-Means, and Self-Organizing Maps. Correlation analysis was then used to examine 
relationships between these discovered clusters. The clustering outcomes were evaluated through static 
and interactive visualizations, enabling dynamic exploration of missingness patterns. The results 
demonstrate clustering as an effective tool for uncovering missing data patterns and enhancing better 
decisions regarding data quality and handling.
